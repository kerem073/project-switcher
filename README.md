# Discription
This is a bash script that makes switching between directories really easy.

# Installing
1. Add the script to your PATH (on linux and Mac it is in ```/usr/local/bin/```. From here you can execute the file anywhere.
2. Add an allias in your DotRC file like so: ```alias pjs=". pjs"```. This let's you execute the script in source mode.

NOTE: when you use the script for the first time, it will make a ".saved_dirs" file in your $HOME where your saved directories will be stored.
